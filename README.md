# Reactjs-Authentation-and-Router

Welcome to the repository for the ReactJS Project! This project is primarily focused on React.js and leverages the powerful features of React Router for navigation. Additionally, a dummy backend has been created to handle authentication for user login and logout processes, utilizing middlewares for enhanced security.

# Features
React.js: The project is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI elements, contributing to a modular and maintainable codebase.
users can create events, delete events , and update events this all is done with authenticating the user requests.

# React Router:
 The project extensively uses React Router for handling navigation and routing within the application. Various features of React Router have been employed, including:

useActionData for Posting data with routes itself
useLoaderData and useParams for dynamic loading of data based on route parameters.
redirect for seamless navigation to different routes.
Direct and relative routing to enable efficient navigation between pages.
Subroutes creation for organizing and managing different sections of the application.
Authentication Backend: A dummy backend has been implemented to facilitate user authentication. Middleware has been integrated to ensure secure user sessions. The project follows the process of sending authentication tokens with every request to the backend. If the response from the backend is successful, the user can access the requested content. Otherwise, an error page is displayed to users, and they are redirected to the login page.
